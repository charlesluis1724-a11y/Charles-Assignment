Observation

RESPONSIVENESS
Home Page responsiveness should be fine @ 1040px upto 2560px. Haven’t made it possible for a tablet and mobile device due to short period of time.

BODY 
- Notice that the Background image is purposely Fixed for visualization. Only to show that Background image is Available. However it’s better to maintain the background on Plain or clean color to give contrast to the content page and make the Interface more accessible to Users.


NAVIGATION 
-on (index.html) try to click “Next Page“ to go to the next page.
-on  (index_page2.html)Try to click “Home Page“ to go back to the Home page.


FORM 
“Button” does not go to page 2 (upon research it needs some validation (tags) from (Java Scrip) 

-bypassed bootstrap setting for border (default - blue) to (WHITE). This one I found difficult to understand how to customize Bootstrap contents.


BLOG PAGE 
-The Website is Available at 2560px and not responsive like the Home Page. the Goal of the Assignment should be responsive but it didn’t get other aspect ratio’s due to short period of time

-I tried to be relevant to the main design system however along the way I found new styles and would like to implement it to other components of the website. I understand the design fundamentals but tried to keep it relevant to each other For me it is important how I understand each tags, element, and behaviors are workings. Next I will be sticking to only one design system.
